          The artistic study of the "TotsÂ», has inspired different methods of
          interpretation and transmutation. To carry out the work, a series of
          imaginal characters have emerged, The Dancers. Each of them represent
          a specific operation that the set of 256 Tots must undergo to reach
          their final form as the Ultrahieroglyphic Language.
